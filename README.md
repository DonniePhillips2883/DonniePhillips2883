## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository! This project showcases my work as a full-stack developer building modern, scalable web applications using Node.js on the backend and React on the frontend. It emphasizes clean API integration, effective state management, and a component-driven UI architecture to deliver responsive, maintainable web experiences.

On the backend, I use Node.js with Express to develop robust RESTful APIs that handle everything from user authentication and data validation to business logic and database interaction. The backend is modular and follows clear architectural patterns, making it easy to scale and extend. Routes are structured for clarity, and middleware is used for tasks like logging, input sanitization, and error handling.

The frontend is powered by React, built around a component-driven architecture. Each UI feature is encapsulated into reusable, declarative components that are easy to test and maintain. I follow modern React practices such as hooks and functional components, along with design patterns that promote separation of concerns and predictable state transitions.

State management is handled using Context API for lightweight global state or tools like Redux, depending on the complexity of the application. Iâ€™ve implemented patterns for managing asynchronous data flows, loading states, and error boundaries, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.

This repository serves as a practical example of full-stack development with Node.js and React, designed to be clear, modular, and production-ready. Whether you're exploring API integration, building a new UI system, or refining state logic, youâ€™ll find scalable patterns and real-world implementations here. Feel free to browse, fork, or contribute!
